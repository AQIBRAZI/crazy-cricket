# Crazy Cricket
Welcome to crazy cricket, the greatest Cricket Video game on earth! You have been recruited to help our data team make the game more engage for users, driving growth in the user base!

# The Problem
So far uptake in the game has been great, users are really enjoying playing each other. However, users would like to know how they stack up against other users. We'd also like to implement a "national leaderboard", so users can see how their country compares to the others. This last feature was especially requested by users in India who want to make sure they are beating the English!

# The Solution
There are two requirements in the implementation:
1. The solution must read Thrift messages off of a Kafka instance
2. The end results must be served via HTTP get requests, and return results as JSON
